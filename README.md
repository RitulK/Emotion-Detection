**Emotion Detector**

This project, developed as part of an IBM course, is an emotion detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with the Embeddable Watson AI Library. It identifies emotions in text data, categorizing it as joy, anger, sadness, fear, and more.

**Project Overview**

The Emotion Detector project leverages NLP techniques to detect emotions in text. Itâ€™s designed for applications in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and mental health support, providing insights into user sentiment and emotional state.

**Features**

Data Preprocessing: Cleans text data, preparing it for emotion analysis through tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.

Emotion Classification: Utilizes the Embeddable Watson AI Library to categorize emotions in text.

Model Evaluation: Measures the accuracy and reliability of the model in detecting various emotions.

**The tasks covered in the Emotion Detector project :**
